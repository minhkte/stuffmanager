Just a util app to manage stuffs. 
My company have alot of testing devices which are sharing between all testers/developers and test users. 
In order to simply proceess of taking/returning devices, I create a simple app to keep-track and manage them. 
Simple: 
1- register devices (1 time)
2- scan to take/return
//TODO: 
3- with ibeacon/NFC, the return process will be trusted and in pre-define place only (eg: your desk/team cabinet ...)
